# Financial and Voting Data Analysis for Module 3 Challenge

## Overview of Financial Records Analysis (PyBank Folder)
The financial data analysis was conducted using Python scripting, leveraging essential data manipulation tools. Key metrics extracted from the data included:
- The total number of months included in the dataset
- The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
- The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
- The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The results were not only displayed on-screen but were also recorded in a dedicated text file.

## Election Data Analysis Overview (PyPoll Folder)
The project aimed to modernize the vote counting process for a town by analyzing voting records, which comprised ballot IDs, counties, and candidate names. The analysis facilitated:
- The total number of votes cast
- A complete list of candidates who received votes
- The percentage of votes each candidate won
- The total number of votes each candidate won
- The winner of the election based on popular vote
Results were similarly output to both the terminal and a text file for documentation.

These analyses were pivotal in simplifying the evaluation of company financials and the electoral process, offering straightforward insights into key performance indicators and election results.
